### Personal Message
```
Nalin,

When planning this day, I thought about creating something unique that might make you smile. Your Twitter conversations about technology and innovation inspired me to find places in San Francisco that blend creativity and technical ingenuity.

The capybaras? Well, they reminded me of how the best connections happen naturally and without pretense. The purple theme adds a touch of the unexpected to our journey, and the hummus... because good conversation deserves equally good food!

This day is designed with thoughtful details and flexibility - a framework for us to enjoy San Francisco while getting to know each other better.

What do you say? Ready for a capybara-approved adventure?

### Why Capybaras Explanation (Hidden until clicked)
```
Why capybaras for our date theme? Because:

1. They're incredibly sociable animals who get along with everyone they meet
2. They're relaxed and unhurried, enjoying life's simple pleasures
3. They're unexpectedly charming once you get to know them
4. They look adorable in purple bow ties

Much like a good first date, capybaras are about creating comfortable connections and enjoying the moment together!

## Hidden Capybara Facts

### Fact 1
```
Capybaras can sleep underwater with just their noses poking out! On our date, we'll keep our heads above water though.
```

### Fact 2
```
Capybaras make a purring sound when content, just like cats! I hope our date leaves us both purring with happiness.
```

### Fact 3
```
Baby capybaras can ride on their parents' backs when swimming! Our date has no swimming planned, but I promise to have your back throughout our adventure.
```

### Fact 4
```
Capybaras have webbed feet to help them swim! The View Lounge has fantastic cocktails, but I promise not to get webbed feet.
```

### Fact 5
```
In Japan, capybaras are often photographed relaxing in hot springs with citrus fruits on their heads! Our date might be less bizarre, but equally memorable.
